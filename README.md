# Blue-Green Deployment Strategy for Dockerized Applications Using Jenkins and Kubernetes

![Project Logo](./Architecture.png) <!-- Replace with your project logo -->

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates a robust pipeline for deploying a Dockerized application using Jenkins in a Kubernetes environment. The pipeline employs a **blue-green deployment strategy**, ensuring minimal downtime and seamless updates. This setup enhances application availability and reliability, making it suitable for production environments.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Seamlessly build, scan, and deploy your application using Jenkins.
- **Dockerized Application**: Effortlessly manage application dependencies and configurations through Docker containers.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Minimize downtime and risks during updates by maintaining two production environments.
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Utilize Kubernetes for effective orchestration, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate security checks to ensure that Docker images meet industry standards.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting of application performance.

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- **Docker**: For containerizing the application
- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD automation
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating the deployment
- **MySQL**: For database management
- **Prometheus**: For monitoring application performance
- **Grafana**: For visualizing metrics
- **Trivy**: For vulnerability scanning of Docker images
